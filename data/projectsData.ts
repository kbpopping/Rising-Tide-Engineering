    status: "COMPLETED 2023",
    fullDescription: "The Lagos Industrial Zone has long suffered from intermittent power supply due to aging infrastructure. This project involved the complete overhaul of the primary distribution substation. The scope included the replacement of 33kV switchgear, installation of new 15MVA transformers, and the integration of a SCADA system for real-time monitoring.",
    challenge: "The primary challenge was executing the upgrade without disrupting power supply to the critical industrial factories operating 24/7 in the zone. Space constraints within the existing substation footprint also required innovative layout planning.",
    solution: "We engineered a phased cutover strategy, utilizing mobile substations to bypass load during critical replacement windows. A compact gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) solution was selected to maximize space efficiency.",
